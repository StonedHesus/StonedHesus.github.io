# StonedHesus.github.io

This here repository hosts my own personal page, which is hosted via GitHub Pages. The page intent is to showcase the various projects and initiatives I am part of, as well as informing people about my various skills, interests and abilities.

# Prerequisites

If you want to load the page locally, then a set of utilities will be required. As of now, the page is under maintainance, and the code base shall be ported to ReScript, which will mean that after the conclusion of the porting process, the page would be able to be served locally via NodeJS, for now Live Server is a good alternative, if not a Python, or C prebuilt server might also fulfill the needs quite nicely.
